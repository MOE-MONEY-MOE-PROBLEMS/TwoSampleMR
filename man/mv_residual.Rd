\usage{
mv_residual(
  mvdat,
  intercept = FALSE,
  instrument_specific = FALSE,
  pval_threshold = 5e-08,

}
\arguments{
\item{mvdat}{Output from \code{mv_harmonise_data}}

\item{intercept}{Should the intercept by estimated (TRUE) or force line through the origin (FALSE, dafault)}

\item{instrument_specific}{Should the estimate for each exposure be obtained by using all instruments from all exposures (FALSE, default) or by using only the instruments specific to each exposure (TRUE)}

\item{plots}{Create plots? FALSE by default}

\item{pval_threshold=5e-8}{P-value threshold to include instruments}

\description{
Performs initial multivariable MR analysis from Burgess et al 2015. For each exposure the outcome is residualised for all the other exposures, then unweighted regression is applied.
